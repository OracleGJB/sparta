I've experimented using Chat GPT already and have gone from this:</p> <p></p> <p>to this:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I also want to add the functionality where the \"customer\" can have an email sent to them confirming their \"order\". I've never tried the PDF generation facilities within Apex. So I'm going to do that to create a good-looking professional document as an attachment.</p> <p>I didn't mention that I'll be using ORDS as well.</p>","tags":["Technology","Oracle","Apex"]},{"location":"archive/2025%2008/","title":"2025 08","text":""},{"location":"category/oracle/","title":"Oracle","text":""},{"location":"category/apex/","title":"Apex","text":""},{"location":"tags/","title":"Tags","text":""},{"location":"tags/#apex","title":"Apex","text":"<ul> <li>Showcase Ideas</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#oracle","title":"Oracle","text":"<ul> <li>Showcase Ideas</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#technology","title":"Technology","text":"<ul> <li>Showcase Ideas</li> </ul>"}]}
